A way to download:
1. Instagram Posts and Profiles.
2. YouTube (Everything).
3. Spofity Playlists and Songs.

For the spotify downloading you will need an API key, you can make one for free here: https://developer.spotify.com/

This is probably outdated and needs a few fixes, but I made it public nevertheless.
